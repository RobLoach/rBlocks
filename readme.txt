Introduction
------------

Thank you for being interested in rBlocks.  This was a quick and dirty Tetris clone that I created to test my programming skills.  You'll notice, if you look at the source, that it's actually quick ugly looking.  This was due to my lack of planning before hand.  On my next project, I'll be sure to plan everything.

Enjoy it!



Note
----

This was done using Dev-C++ (http://www.bloodshed.net) and SDL ().  You will need both to compile it correctly.  You may be able to compile in MSVC, but don't ask me for any help with that.  If you plan on looking at the code and maybe copying a bit of it, I don't care.  Just acknowledge my efforts and work I put into this project.  Thanks again, and enjoy.
